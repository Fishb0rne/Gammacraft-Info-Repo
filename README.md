## JustTPA
### Player to Player teleportation system, allowing for instant ~~transmission~~ teleportation between players.
**/tpa <player name>** sends said player a teleport request, and they can use either **/tpa accept** or **/tpa deny** to accept or deny your teleport request.

## Waypoints
### Waypoints system allowing for setting up both public and private teleportation points, all accessible via commands.
**/wp add** adds a given waypoint. EX: [/wp add TEST pub] would add a waypoint at your coordinates named TEST, and [/wp add TEST] (without the "pub") would add it to a player only private list
**/wp rm** is used to remove a given public or private lists following the same rules as /wp add. This seems to be available for either everyone or no one, so be nice yall, honor system.
**/wp tp** is used to teleport to a given waypoint. EX: [/wp tp TEST pub] would teleport you to the public waypoint named TEST. Same rules as **/wp add** in regards to private waypoints
