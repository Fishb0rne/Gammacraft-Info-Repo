Feel free to ask us directly if theres information you can't seem to find on a specific command.

## Minepacks
### A backpack plugin that gives you access to a 6x9 extra inventory, accessible via the Backpack item or a command! Has Keep Inventory enabled, making it perfect for storing special, personal items.
**/Backpack** opens your backpack, [Esc] closes it, shrimple. You can also right click the Backpack item in your inventory in order to open it.

## ChatColor2
### A Chat color plugin that allows for customizing (albeit to a limited extent) the color of your messages in game! Including up to 6 modifiers on top of colors.

## JustTPA
### Player to Player teleportation system, allowing for instant ~~transmission~~ teleportation between players.
**/tpa <player name>** sends said player a teleport request, and they can use either **/tpa accept** or **/tpa deny** to accept or deny your teleport request.

## Waypoints (ty gammy mmwah <3)
### Waypoints system allowing for setting up both public and private teleportation points, all accessible via commands.
**/wp add** adds a given waypoint. EX: [/wp add TEST pub] would add a waypoint at your coordinates named TEST, and [/wp add TEST] (without the "pub") would add it to a player only private list

**/wp rm** is used to remove a given public or private lists following the same rules as /wp add. This seems to be available for either everyone or no one, so be nice yall, honor system.

**/wp tp** is used to teleport to a given waypoint. EX: [/wp tp TEST pub] would teleport you to the public waypoint named TEST. Same rules as **/wp add** in regards to private waypoints

## EpicRename

**/rename** renames the item currently in your hand.

**/lore** "relores" any item, changing it's tooltip to whatever you'd like. Text formatting is a little,, odd. It'll create a continuous line unless you manually break it using |.

Test Test Test

Test Test Test

ABC ABC ABC

## Passive Plugins
### XPBonus, FishingRewards, Treefeller, Geyser/Floodgate/ViaVersion, VillagerSaver
XPBonus is a passive and universal 3x Experience Multiplier. No more grinding for EXP

FishingRewards is a system to encourage fishing! You can get a small hanbful of bonus items that would otherwise take a lot of adventuring off the island in order to find! If you have any ideas for these "loot boxes" you get from fishing, such as any items that would actively take days to find adventuring, lmk on discord!!!

TreeFeller (ty seb mmwah <3) is a plugin that destroys and bunches up all logs on a tree by breaking it's base. Simple, useful.

Geyser/Floodgate/ViaVersion are all backend plugins allowing for Bedrock clients to join the server!!

Villager Saver allows for Villagers to always turn into zombie villagers where attacked by zombies, bypassing the world's Easy mode 0% chance and changing it to 100%.

# If you have any submissions for plugins you'd like to see, lmk on Discord!!
